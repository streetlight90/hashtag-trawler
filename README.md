# hashtag-trawler
*A python tool to find related images and display them*
## Initial notes
### Plugins
Plugins are the customisable bits of the trawler. They are small classes that connect to photo repositories on the internet in order to collect the photos for the application
### Date settings
The application should be able to be programmed to only care about photos uploaded or taken within certain time frames (i.e. events)
### Language
The initial language is python although there might be a better platform for displaying the images, suggestions welcome :koala:
